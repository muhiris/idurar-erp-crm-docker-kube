# DevOps Project: E-Commerce Platform Migration and Modernization

A comprehensive hands-on project that give you deep, real-world DevOps experience across the entire pipeline from development to deployment and operations.

## Project Overview

You'll take an existing open-source three-tier e-commerce application and transform it through a complete DevOps lifecycle:

1. Migrate from traditional deployment to containerized microservices
2. Implement infrastructure as code
3. Set up CI/CD pipelines
4. Deploy to AWS with Kubernetes
5. Establish monitoring, logging, and observability
6. Implement security scanning and compliance checks

## Phase 1: Application Selection and Initial Setup

**Tasks:**

- Fork an open-source three-tier e-commerce application (like OpenCart, Spree Commerce, or PrestaShop)
- Set up local development environment
- Document the current architecture
- Create a project backlog in Jira/GitHub Projects
- Set up a Git repository with branch protection rules

## Phase 2: Containerization

**Tasks:**

- Break down the monolithic application into microservices:
  - Frontend (UI)
  - Product service
  - Cart service
  - User service
  - Order service
  - Payment service
- Create Dockerfiles for each service
- Set up Docker Compose for local development
- Implement health checks
- Optimize container images (multi-stage builds, security)

## Phase 3: Infrastructure as Code

**Tasks:**

- Create Terraform modules for AWS resources:
  - VPC, subnets, routing tables
  - EKS cluster
  - RDS databases
  - ElastiCache
  - S3 buckets
  - CloudFront distribution
- Implement state management with S3 and DynamoDB
- Set up environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
- Create Ansible playbooks for configuration management
- Implement GitOps principles with infrastructure versioning

## Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline

**Tasks:**

- Implement Jenkins or GitHub Actions pipelines with:
  - Code quality checks (SonarQube)
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Security scanning (SAST with tools like Snyk)
  - Container vulnerability scanning
  - Infrastructure validation
- Set up parallel execution for faster builds
- Implement canary deployments
- Create promotion workflows between environments

## Phase 5: Kubernetes Deployment

**Tasks:**

- Create Kubernetes manifests for all services
- Implement Helm charts for deployment management
- Set up Kubernetes namespaces for environment separation
- Configure ingress controllers and service meshes (Istio)
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling
- Set up persistent volumes for stateful services
- Configure ConfigMaps and Secrets management
- Implement network policies and pod security

## Phase 6: Monitoring and Observability

**Tasks:**

- Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- Implement ELK or EFK stack for logging
- Set up distributed tracing with Jaeger or AWS X-Ray
- Create custom dashboards for service health
- Configure alerts and notifications
- Implement SLOs and SLIs
- Create runbooks for common issues

## Phase 7: Security and Compliance

**Tasks:**

- Implement AWS security best practices
- Set up IAM roles and policies with least privilege
- Implement secret rotation
- Configure WAF and DDoS protection
- Run regular penetration testing
- Implement compliance checks (CIS benchmarks)
- Set up automated security scanning in the pipeline

## Phase 8: Performance Testing and Optimization

**Tasks:**

- Create performance testing scripts with JMeter or Locust
- Implement load testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- Analyze and optimize application performance
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize database queries
- Set up auto-scaling policies based on metrics

## Phase 9: Disaster Recovery and Backup

**Tasks:**

- Implement backup and restore procedures
- Create disaster recovery plans
- Test failover scenarios
- Implement multi-region deployments
- Set up database replication

## Phase 10: Documentation and Knowledge Base

**Tasks:**

- Create comprehensive documentation for all components
- Document architecture decisions
- Create onboarding guides for new team members
- Document operational procedures and runbooks

## Extension Ideas

- Implement blue/green deployments
- Add feature flagging with tools like LaunchDarkly
- Implement chaos engineering with Chaos Monkey
- Add cost optimization and reporting
- Implement GitOps with tools like ArgoCD or Flux

This project covers the entire DevOps lifecycle and will give you hands-on experience with real-world scenarios and challenges that DevOps engineers face daily. By completing this project, you'll have built a portfolio piece that demonstrates your skills across the entire DevOps spectrum.
